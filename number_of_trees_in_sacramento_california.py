# Can use Google Maps to sample the number of trees in 3 different regions

# can just get approximate perimeter and compute number of trees per mile across permiter with

# Get approximate permiter of city
# Square root of 994 (994 square is the area), so the square root x 4 gives us an estimate of the permiter - factor a margin of error of 30%
